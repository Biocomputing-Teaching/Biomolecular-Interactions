# Practical Session 01

## Requirements

* Setting up your computer with a Linux or macOS operating system (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Install Conda and Jupyter Lab (see [course repository](https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Introduction-to-Bioinformatics))
* Complete the "Learn the Basics" entries in the [Python Tutorial](https://www.learnpython.org/en/)

## To begin

In this session, we will review some basic binding equations using Python. It is imperative to have completed the basic parts of the Python tutorial.

Some basic Python concepts are needed, so please review them before the session:

- [Python Data Types](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_variable_types.htm)
- [Python function](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm)

To start the session, you'll need the files inside the theoretical/T02 folder in this repository. To do that is better to have the full repository cloned in your computer:

On your terminal, navigate to a location where you want to download the course repository and execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/Biocomputing-Teaching/Biomolecular-Interactions.git
```

This command will create a folder named "Biomolecular-Interactions" containing the full repository at its latest version.

Navigate to the Theoretical Session 02 directory:

```
cd cd Biomolecular-Interactions/theoretical/T02/
```

And open the Jupyter notebook inside this folder:

```
jupyter-notebook ExploringMolecularBinding.ipynb
```

The content of this notebook can also be consulted at the following link:
