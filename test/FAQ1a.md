# Molecular dynamics calculations vs Monte Carlo simulations


|  Molecular Dynamics (MD)	| Monte Carlo (MC) 	|
|-	|-	|
| Provides information about dynamical behavior and equilibrium	|  Can only give static, equilibrium properties	|
|  Motions of particles (atoms, molecules) are natural following classical (Newtonian) mechanics	| Movements are artificial (random) 	|
|  	|  	|
|  	|  	|
|  	|  	|
|  	|  	|

Both can be used to produce thermodynamics properties.
