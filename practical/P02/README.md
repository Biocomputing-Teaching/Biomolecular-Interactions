# Protein-protein Docking with pyDock

### Requirements

* Setting up your computer with a Linux or macOS operating system (see course repository)

* Install Conda and Jupyter Lab (see course repository)

* Complete the "Learn the Basics" entries in the Python Tutorial

* Install Chimera for molecular visualization

[Download Chimera](https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html)

* Install the MDTraj Python library

conda install -c conda-forge mdtraj

* Install the Pandas Python library (see below)

conda install -c anaconda pandas

### Introduction

In this tutorial, we will perform an example docking calculation using the PyDock program for Docking analysis. The program and its dependencies will be installed during the practical session to have control over the installation process. Program files can be found in the "programs" folder, with the exception of PyDock which needs a license to be used or distributed.
