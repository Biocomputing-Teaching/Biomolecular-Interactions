    "\n",
    "Protein-protein interactions lie at the heart of cellular control mechanisms. Protein molecules in the cell interact either permanently or transiently. Many types of chemical interactions are involved in a protein-protein complex; knowing this interaction can help us understand how many of the biochemical processes involving these proteins are regulated.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practice session we will employ the docking software PyDock. We will follow the installation steps, and use it to dock two protein partners.  We will repeat the docking procedure using experimental information about which residues pertaing to the protein-protein complex interface. While the docking commands will be run using the terminal, we will load the output files in this notebook to make analyse the docking results."

    "\n",
    "We will put the downloaded pyDock copy into the programs/pyDock directory.\n",

    "### Installing PyDock\n",
    "\n",
    "One you have a copy of the pyDock program we can proceed to installing it in our computer. To make the docking calculations pyDock uses either FTDock or ZDOCK external programs. In this ocassion, we will procede to install the FTDock program first. FTDock, in turn, depends on the FFTW2.1 library.\n",
