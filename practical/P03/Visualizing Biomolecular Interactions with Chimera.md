# Visualizing Biomolecular Interactions with Chimera

In this session we will make use of some tools in Chimera that can be useful to visualize biomolecular interactions.
We will have a look at the crystal structure of a tethered dimer of hiv-1 protease complexed with the inhibitor A79 (a short name for the beatiful N-{1-benzyl-(2s,3s)-2,3-dihydroxy-4-[3-methyl-2-(3-methyl-3-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-ureido)-butyrylamino]-5-phenyl-pentyl}-3-methyl-2-(3-methyl-3-pyridin-2-ylmethyl-ureido)-butyramide). The PDB code for this system is `1HVC`.
